> Describe your project in detail, include any screenshots or designs. What problem does it solve? What is the current state of the project? 
> **FreeHumans.World** is an open source network created by the people for the people, with a sustainable tokenomics long term, based on multiple real utilities (the token will continuously self-distribute uniformly due to our unique Share2Earn and Like2Give algorithms). I started doing R&D since 2017 into sustainable tokenomics and crypto marketing and there was no data or tools to model and predict the evolution of tokenomics models. Apparently, everyone had used what I now call "pizza tokenomics" - which means: "We have no idea what tokenomics is, we're still pioneering this stuff, but we saw other people do it like this and it worked, so copy paste a pie chart from google images and LFG". So I created some tools to simulate the evolution of value distribution among different networks of users, from Web 2 to Web 3 models or systems with different tokenomics parameters: https://w3x.info/simulation.html (visit and click Web 3 button)
> The FreeHumans.World dApp is an open source, gamified and decentralized social network that runs a tokenomics model similar to what an UBI (Universal Basic Income) system would be, but much more awesome than that.
> The code is licensed under GPL 3.0 open source license.

> **The Problem:** The current social platforms operate within centralized, hierarchical models that concentrate power and wealth, limiting democratic participation and equitable wealth distribution among users. Gen Z and younger are not making Facebook and other Web 2 accounts anymore. This produces socio-economic effects in the global economy akin to a cardiac arrest in a sanguine system.
These Web 2 platforms often lack mechanisms for genuine user engagement, ownership, and value creation, leading to a digital ecosystem dominated by a few entities and algorithms, where user contributions are undervalued and users are treated as products for an end result (conversion) that today has become very expensive due to saturation (according to the Metcalfeâ€™s law problem). In other words, with the exception of TikTok, almost all Web 2 platforms have a very poor conversion rate (offering very expensive exposure to users through traditional saturated web 2 advertising systems).
The post .com bubble or the Web 2 bubble has popped. We have seen massive layoffs and revenue drops in these companies. AI & blockchain is leveling the playing field once again as startups are figuring out what Web 3 looks like. The last time this happened was when Search and Social Media killed Yahoo, the biggest web company in the Web 1 era.

> **The Solution:** FreeHumans.World introduces a new Web 3 social network (dApp) that integrates gamification, blockchain, and AI technologies to redefine digital sociocultural ecosystems and exposure markets (NFTs with real utility and regular markets similar to ebay.com - priced in XPR coin and GRAT token). The dApp aims to democratize digital engagement and ownership through decentralized governance and non-discriminating instant participatory economics. The platform employs new algorithms backed by Gratitude Tokens ($GRAT) to innovate economic exchange, enabling users to earn through various forms of digital engagement and to use tokes for more exposure to the network. It emphasizes authenticity and security with Quantum Resistant Encryption (SSS) and a unique, invite-only membership model. This approach seeks to shift from centralized control to a decentralized, equitable, and participatory model, fostering a digital environment where community, creativity, and democratic values thrive. The main value propositions are: Community Management, Autonomy, Ownership, Quantum Resistant Security and Quality engagement, all under a gamified experience.

### Ecosystem Fit

> 1. Where and how does your project fit into the XPR Network ecosystem?
  **FreeHumans.World** aims to increase the number of accounts on XPR network by up to 3 billion eventually and since it will accept XPR alongside the GRAT token in the markets integrated it's hard to imagine the huge impact that it will potentially have on the blockchain adoption and awareness. One thing is for certain, it will not be a small impact. 
> 2. Who is your target audience?

> 3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects?

### Team

> List the members of your team, including their roles and responsibilities. Include links to their LinkedIn profiles, Github repos, and any other relevant information.

### Roadmap

> Include a roadmap for your project and timeline. This section should be detailed (will vary on project scope).

### Milestones

> Below is an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the XPR Network ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone â‰ˆ 1 month.

> For each milestone make sure to include detailed specification of your software. Include the amount of funding requested per milestone, as well as the number of full-time employees working on each milestone. This information should be included in the milestone deliverables.

> FTE: Full-Time Equivalent (Number of people working on the project on a full-time basis)

> Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project milestone. If the grant is paid out in XPR the amount will be calculated based on the XPR/USD exchange rate on the time of payment.

### Milestone Example

- **Milestone:** 1
- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
