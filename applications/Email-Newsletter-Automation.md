# XPR Network Grant Proposal

### Project Details

This grant seeks to set up an automated series of emails to be sent to new email subscribers every 2 weeks for 6 months.

As of January 2024, there is a clear call-to-action at the bottom of the homepage for https://xprnetwork.org/. It says: 
*“The XPR Newsletter - Second To Layer None - Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest development updates, bounties, product launches + more.”*
However, upon subscribing, users are not sent any emails.

I propose to create 12 fortnightly emails, to be sent out every 2 weeks to new email subscribers, over their first 6 months on the list. These emails would share the core values of the project, demonstrate its utility, guide new community members to existing projects in the XPR network, and highlight the variety of use cases.

### Ecosystem Fit

> 1. Where and how does your project fit into the XPR Network ecosystem?
The purpose of this project is to document many of the facets of the ecosystem, and educate new members of the variety of existing projects and use cases. Each email will highlight 1-3 different projects within the ecosystem, and give clear instructions on how to participate and interact.

> 2. Who is your target audience?
The XPR Network community, and the XPR-curious.

> 3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects?
There are so many interrelated projects between the Metal Blockchain, XPR Network, and Metallicus, that it can be overwhelming for new users to know where to begin. I propose to create a series of handy, step-by-step guides that demonstrate the utility of a variety of projects, without overwhelming the new subscriber with too much information. These guides will be sent every 2 weeks over 6 months.

### Roadmap

- **Week 1:** - Collect existing assets, identify topic flow, write draft 1 subject lines, create swipe folder. Set up new ConvertKit account, if needed, or access existing email service provider. Communicate with web devs about integration options.
- **Week 2:** -  Copywriting draft 1 for 12 emails. Test email integration on orphan page. Review DMARC records and test email deliverability.
- **Week 3:** -  Copywriting draft 2 for 12 emails. Design graphic email template. Collect assets for rotating sections.
- **Week 4:** -  Migrate copy from Google Docs into email service provider. Test and troubleshoot subscription process and UX. Publish final drafts on internal page for easy review. Hand over logins to designated Consortium members.

Every week, I will need at least 30 minutes on a Zoom call with at least 1 Consortium member (preferably Will Cleaver) to ask questions, get feedback, and brainstorm ideas.

### Future Plans

> How do you intend to enhance, promote and support your project in the future?
In future grant proposals, I plan to work on content creation, video production, and list building. This will require ongoing maintenance of the ConvertKit account, and using automated tagging strategy to create segments of the email list based on their interests and activity.

My plan is to grow the email newsletter list into an evergreen resource for the XPR Network community to educate new members. We can use this as a vehicle to create lead generation funnels, as well as content which documents the multitude of projects in the ecosystem, so that new members of the community can educate themselves about everything the XPR Network can do.

### Additional Information

This is our first project for the XPR Network, but hopefully, not the last. Through this project, I aim to gain deep knowledge of the ecosystem and the constellation of companies and services that surround it, to identify more marketing projects in the future. 

While I have many future ideas for marketing - creating whitepapers, video tutorials, lead magnets, and gamified onboarding experiences - for this proposal, I am focusing on a single project that can have the most impact quickly.

Upon successful completion, I plan to submit another grant for 3-6 months of marketing work, based on a needs analysis completed during this project.
