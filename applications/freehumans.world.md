> **FreeHumans.World** is an open source network created by the people for the people, with a sustainable tokenomics long term, based on multiple real utilities.
> The Gratitude Token (GRAT) is a currency that is used firstly to continuously self-distribute all the value generated by the network of users uniformly and globally, due to our unique Share2Earn and Like2Give algorithms + other amazing features that will be available for all users for free.
> 
**Background Story:**
> My name is Lucian Apetrei, I have been doing web and marketing R&D for more than 16 years. I've been quietly solving multi-million dollar problems for IT companies for the past decade and a half. I've worked for companies like IBM, 888 Holdings, Ipsos, Svea Finans, Humans.ai and others.
> I am involved into multiple projects, but I started doing R&D into sustainable tokenomics since 2017.
> 
> Since then, I learned so much about our "Money Planet". I learned about the central banking system, I learned about the history of money, about trading in different markets and the nature of efficient markets.
> I spend around 200K euro over the years from my own pocket, building different projects.
> I ran one of the top mining pools for Electroneum coin a few years ago with a Discord community of 1800 members at it's peak, most of them miners. I created a 108 graphic cards + 13 asics mining farm by myself, modified their bios to mine more efficiently. I sold it as I don't believe in PoW anymore.
> 
> Two years ago I quit my cozy corporate job and founded GratitudeToken.world, put together a team and used FFF money (Founders, Family, Friends) to try and develop a true Web 3 protocol or platform where decentralization of value and knowledge was done right.
> 
> When I started testing blockchains for GratitudeToken.World about 2 years ago, after talking to core teams of EOS, IOTA and others... I couldn't find a mature enough and actively developed blockchain that I could use and almost gave up on my dream project before XPR showed up out of nowhere.
>
> Once I found the perfect blockchain solution, I knew there was no useful data or tools available to model and predict the evolution of tokenomics models. Apparently, everyone had used what I now call "pizza tokenomics" - which means: "We have no idea what tokenomics is, we're still pioneering this stuff, but we saw other people do it like this and it worked, so copy paste a pie chart from google images and LFG".
> 
> So I created some tools to simulate the evolution of value distribution among different networks of users over time, from Web 2 to Web 3 models or systems with different tokenomics parameters: https://w3x.info/simulation.html (visit and click Web 3 button)
> 
**What is FreeHumans.World again?**
> It's an open source dApp, a gamified and decentralized social network that runs a tokenomics model similar to what an UBI (Universal Basic Income) system would be, but much more awesome than that.
> The code is licensed under GPL 3.0 open source license.

**The Problem:**
> The current social platforms (Web 2 "social" media) operate within centralized, hierarchical models that concentrate power and wealth, limiting democratic participation and equitable wealth distribution among users.
> In other words, they are exploiting us, censoring us, keeping us in echo chambers and controlling the narrative while shoving ads that we don't care about in our face. The Netflix documentary named "The Social Dilemma" is a must watch on this topic.
> 
> Gen Z and younger are not making Facebook and other Web 2 accounts anymore. This produces socio-economic effects in the global economy akin to a cardiac arrest in a sanguine system.
These Web 2 platforms have become too cluttered and they lack mechanisms for genuine user engagement, ownership, and value creation, leading to a digital ecosystem dominated by a few entities and algorithms, where user contributions are undervalued and users are treated as products for an end result (conversion) that today has become very expensive due to saturation (according to the Metcalfe’s law problem). In other words, with the exception of TikTok, almost all Web 2 platforms have a very poor conversion rate (offering very expensive exposure to users through traditional saturated web 2 advertising systems).
> 
> Data indicates that the post .com bubble or the Web 2 bubble has popped. We have seen massive layoffs and revenue drops in these companies. AI & blockchain is leveling the playing field once again as startups are figuring out what Web 3 looks like. The last time this happened was when Search and Social Media killed Yahoo, the biggest web company in the Web 1 era.

**The Solution:**
> FreeHumans.World introduces an alternative, a new Web 3 social network (dApp) that integrates gamification, blockchain, and AI technologies to redefine digital sociocultural ecosystems and exposure markets (NFTs with real utility and regular markets similar to ebay.com - priced in XPR coin and GRAT token).
>
> Up to 99% of the GRAT token will be distributed for free to 1-3 billion users on signup. The dApp aims to democratize digital engagement and ownership through decentralized governance and non-discriminating instant participatory economics.
>
> The platform employs new algorithms backed by Gratitude Tokens ($GRAT) to innovate economic exchange, enabling users to earn through various forms of digital engagement and to use tokes for more exposure to the network. It emphasizes authenticity and security with Quantum Resistant Encryption (SSS) and a unique, invite-only membership model. This approach seeks to shift from centralized control to a decentralized, equitable, and participatory model, fostering a digital environment where community, creativity, and democratic values thrive.

### Ecosystem Fit

1. Where and how does your project fit into the XPR Network ecosystem?
> **FreeHumans.World** aims to increase the number of accounts on XPR network by up to 3 billion eventually and since it will accept XPR alongside the GRAT token in its markets it will be hard to calculate the huge impact that it will potentially have on the blockchain adoption, XPR price and awareness of the XPR network. One thing is for certain, it will not be a small impact.

3. Who is your target audience?
> Our main audience in the first phase of marketing and adoption is Generation Z and younger (people up to 26 years old), but also Millenials and others. They total about 3 billion real human beings that can potentially be empowered by becoming a FreeHumans.world user. The scalability is huge and our marketing strategy ensures we will get a lot of users fast as each new user must recruit 2 other users in order to get the reward and you cannot trick the system with fake accounts. Read the Business Plan linked at the top for more details about our "Power of 100 - exponential marketing strategy".
> 
3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects?
> We will not sabotage the project by selling most of the supply to investors like most “pizza tokenomics” projects did.
>
> Up to 99% of the total supply will be distributed to hopefully 3 Billion users or more, starting with our exponential marketing strategy that you can read in our Web 3 business plan linked at the top.
> 
> We are not asking for money from investors first and promising to deliver utility and services later, we believe in value first, monetization later.
>
> So the listing of our GRAT token will only happen once we have enough users to sustain a balanced demand and supply on the exchanges and the users will be the ones to sell, but also the ones to buy it back as they will continuously need it to participate in all the utilities the dApp will provide for users, all paid with GRAT token, while the Markets will also accept XPR coin.
> 
> The main value propositions are:
> - *Autonomy*
> - *Individual and Collective Ownership*
> - *Free active shares in the project through receiving GRAT tokens on signup or through multiple gamified mechanisms later*
> - *Exposure vs Value trading for posts (Share2Earn algo)*
> - *Free Instant Crowd-funding for posts (Like2Give algo)*
> - *Quantum Resistant Security*
> - *Community Governance*
> - *Quality Organic Engagement*
> - *Gamified experience with rewards that give real benefits*
