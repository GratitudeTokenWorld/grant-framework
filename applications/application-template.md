### Project Details

> Build3rs Labs presents the XPR Governance Tracker, an analytics system deployed on Twitter (@XPRGovernance) and Telegram. We are a team of developers who have noticed a recent decline in decentralized governance participation and we believe that the XPR Governance system that we are building can help to reverse this trend.
 
The XPR Governance system is an analytics bot that can increase engagement and participation in the governance process. It tracks and summarizes governance proposals and discussions and displays this information on Twitter (@XPRGovernance), making it easy for community members to stay informed.
 
The account also provides a platform for community members to share their thoughts and ideas, which can lead to more informed decisions that benefit all network users.


### Ecosystem Fit

> The XPR Governance Tracker aligns with the XPR Network ecosystem by providing transparency in governance processes. It supports the decentralized nature of XPR by helping community members with information and encouraging their active involvement in shaping the network's future. The target audience includes XPR community members, developers, technology enthusiasts, investors and the general public.

### Team

> Build3rs Labs help networks and protocols building meaningful web3 features by challenging the status quo. We are fine with doxxing on a call with the Team.

### Roadmap

> Regular updates and maintenance routines will be scheduled to adapt the bot to changes in the governance system or Twitter APIs and to introduce new features based on ongoing user feedback.

We plan to complete the project within five weeks. Our main deliverables are V1 of the bot on Telegram and V2 of the system on Twitter. During the development, the team and community will be invited to test and provide feedbacks of the analytics system to make changes and add more data if needed.

> Features & Functionality:

Proposal data: The bot will systematically track new proposals, encompassing details such as proposal title, description, creator address, submission timestamp and any associated metadata relevant to the proposal's nature or context.

Proposal status: Regular tracking guarantees that the bot stays updated with proposals that are in progress, quickly adjusting to any modifications or updates in proposal specifics as they arise.

Vote tracking: The proposed vote tracking system involves the bot posting updates when a delegate with over X votes casts a new vote on a proposal. This could be done by retweeting the original proposal tweet with the updated data to bring more visibility. The information displayed would ideally include the voting address and later, the Twitter handle. The system would also present the amount voted and the voting stance.

Voting results: Once a proposal concludes, the bot will extract and disseminate a thorough report on the results, divulging the number of votes in favor, against and whether any quorum requirements were met.

Activity alert : If there is a significant amount of activity on a proposal, the bot will post an alert on Twitter to inform users.

Tweeting Mechanism:
The bot's tweeting mechanism is engineered to distill complex governance data into succinct and informative tweets, providing the community with accessible summaries.

Proposal tweets: For new proposals, the bot's tweets will be comprehensive, featuring the proposal title, detailed description, creator identity and a direct link to the governance page for a deeper exploration.

Live voting updates: During the voting phase, the bot will issue timely tweets offering updates on voter turnout, any noteworthy developments and encouraging community members to participate actively.

Outcome announcements: For concluded proposals, the bot's tweets will spotlight the final results, underlining whether the proposal passed or failed and elucidating any pertinent consequences or implementations.
